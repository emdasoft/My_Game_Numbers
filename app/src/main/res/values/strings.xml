        Number composition game for preschoolers. \n
        Purpose: To improve knowledge about the composition of the studied numbers.
        Build the ability to present numbers as the sum of two terms (based on visibility). \n
        Rules of the game: there will be three figures in front of you,
        two from below and one from above.
        Two of them will have numbers. It is necessary that the sum of the numbers
        from the two lower figures be equal to
        number in the top figure, for this you need to select the missing number
        (term) from the answer options. \n
        Example in the upper circle is the number 7, in one of the lower squares the number is 4,
        and the other is a question mark. So the number 3 should be in place of the question mark.
        (because 3 + 4 = 7)
